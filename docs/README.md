# Overview of the Microsoft Bookings API

The [Microsoft Bookings API][api] allows [Office 365 Business Premium][o365]
subscribers to manage their [Bookings][] data using the [Microsoft Graph][graph].

## Getting Started

In order to use the Bookings API you will need:

- **An [Office 365 Business Premium][o365] tenant in which you can create users and [Bookings][] resources.**  
  _You can create a trial tenant by going to [products.office.com][bookings], click **Buy now with Office 365** and select **Free Trial**._

- **You'll need to register client applications in [Azure Active Directory][aad] and request permissions to call Bookings using Graph.**

  - Open https://portal.azure.com then go to Active Directory->App Registrations
  - Create a new application and take note of its Application ID and Redirect Uri.
  - Edit the settings of the application. Under 'Required Permissions', add API access to 'Microsoft Graph' and select 'Manage bookings information'.

- **Clone the [bookings-samples][samples] repository
  and update your local copy with the Application ID and Redirect Uri of your Azure AD application.**

## Authentication

Applications that wish to access the [Bookings API][api] must acquire tokens to communicate with Graph.
The access token used with the API must contain the identity of an Office 365 user with subscriptions and permissions to use Bookings.

> NOTE: at the time of this writing, the Bookings API does NOT support application-only permissions.

An example for obtaining a token in a native C# application using [Active Directory Authentication Libraries (ADAL)][adal] goes like this:

```csharp
var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext("https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/");

var authenticationResult = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(
  "https://graph.microsoft.com/",
  clientApplication_ClientId,
  clientApplication_RedirectUri,
  new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.RefreshSession));

// The results of this call are sent as the Authorization header of each HTTPS request to Graph.
var authorizationHeader = authenticationResult.CreateAuthorizationHeader();
```

## Client Libraries

.Net applications can use ODATA v4 client-side proxy classes, such as the ones
provided by the [Microsoft ODATA Stack][client].

The [bookings-samples][samples] repository contains such a generated client library, with just the types needed to access Bookings.
With it, a C# application can initialize a `GraphService` with code like this:

```csharp
var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext(GraphService.DefaultAadInstance, TokenCache.DefaultShared);

var authenticationResult = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(
    GraphService.ResourceId,
    clientApplicationAppId,
    clientApplicationRedirectUri,
    new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.RefreshSession)).Result;

var graphService = new GraphService(
    GraphService.ServiceRoot,
    () => authenticationResult.CreateAuthorizationHeader());
```

## Booking Entities, Operations and Permissions Scopes

For additional information about Booking entities, operations and permission scopes see the [Microsoft Graph documentation][api].
